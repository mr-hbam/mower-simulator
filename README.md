> This project simulates autonomous mowers operating on a rectangular lawn. Each mower has a position, orientation, and a set of movement commands. The simulator executes the commands concurrently using Node.js worker threads and calculates the final positions and orientations of all mowers.

## Features
- Supports multiple mowers on a shared lawn.
- Executes commands: move forward (`F`), turn left (`L`), turn right (`R`).
- Concurrency handled via Node.js Worker Threads.
- Stores and outputs the final positions and orientations of all mowers.
- Graceful error handling for mower or worker failures.
- Fully testable with Jest (mocked workers for unit tests).

## Input
The simulator reads mower instructions from a **text file** (`.txt`).

- Place the input file **`input.txt`** in the **`./input/` folder** at the root of the project (create it if it doesn‚Äôt exist).
- **First line:** Lawn max coordinates (`X Y`)
- **Next lines:** For each mower, two lines:
    1. Initial position and orientation (`X Y N|E|S|W`)
    2. Movement commands (`L`, `R`, `F`)
